# # TypeScript Simple Calculator with npm
simple calculator application implemented in TypeScript and built using npm (Node Package Manager). The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, including instructions for testing using the npx command line:

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm (Node Package Manager)](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the calculator up and running on your local machine:

### Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:
    
```bash
    mkdir calculator
    cd calculator
 ```

**Initialize a new Node.js project:**
```bash
npm init -y
```

**Install TypeScript as a development dependency:**:

```bash
    npm install typescript --save-dev
```

**Compile TypeScript files**:

```bash
    tsc
    node file.js
```

**Run the tests**   
Use `npx` to run the tests, run the command in the console to see the results .

```bash
   npx project-00-simp1e-calculator
 ```
The calculator will start, and you can perform calculations using the command-line interface.

## Usage

To use the calculator, follow these steps:

1. Run the calculator by executing `npx project-00-simp1e-calculator` in your terminal.
2. Enter the numbers and choose the operation you want to perform (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
3. Press enter to see the result of your calculation.


created a simple calculator application using TypeScript with npm and tested it using npx. You can further expand this application by adding more functionality or additional test cases.

Happy coding!
