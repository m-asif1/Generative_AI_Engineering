# ATM

This somewhat complex TypeScript/Node.js project is a console-based application. When the system starts the user is prompted with a user id and user pin. After entering the details successfully, the ATM functionalities are unlocked. All the user data is generated randomly. 

🔍Run the calculator by executing 'npx pr0ject02_atm' in your terminal console.
